## Recreating a popular mobile game in python
In this project I have put my python skills to a test, trying to recreate a popular mobile game "Dont touch the spikes" im Pygame. This is my take on one of prof. Janusz Szwabi≈Ñski's exercises form one of his programming course exercise lists.

In order to try the game yourself, clone the code of this projeckt to a directory on your device. After that run the folowing command on a command prompt of your choise (make sure you are in the directory to which you downlowded the code).

```bash
python main.py
```
