# Pygame_Project
## Recreating a popular mobile game in python
In this project I have put my python skills to a test, trying to recreate a popular mobile game "Dont touch the spikes" im Pygame. This is my take on one of prof. Janusz Szwabi≈Ñski's exercises form one of his programming course exercise lists.


## Usage

In order to try the game yourself, clone the code of this projeckt to a directory on your device. After that run the folowing command on a command prompt of your choise (make sure you are in the directory to which you downlowded the code).

```bash
python main.py
```
## Requirements
The "Pygame" library used in this project does not come preinstalled in vanilla python. In order to get the game running you might need to run the following command in the command prompt (again make sure you are in the directory to which you downlowded the code).

```bash
pip install -r requriements.txt
```

## Project state
This project is finished.
